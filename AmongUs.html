<p>In 2018, a game about betraying others and being suspicious of those you are playing with came out. This game only had 30 players at one time, but then one week during the Covid Pandemic it blew up. It blew up so fast and got so big that it had a significant impact on the culture of the United States. As one of the most iconic games ever to be created, the developers have used their game for good, and created new lingo on the tips of many tongues.</p>
<p><strong>THE GAME THAT POPPED UP OUT OF THE VENT</strong></p>
<p>Among Us, the game about betrayal and people being &ldquo;sus,&rdquo; or suspect, became popular in the days of the Coronavirus in 2020. &ldquo;The concept of the game is simple,&rdquo; and so it has caught on (. Crewmates, the good guys, of various colors and head attire complete tasks on a spaceship, but there are Imposters, the bad guys, who work together to &ldquo;kill&rdquo; the crewmates one by one. Both Crewmates and Imposters can vote people off the ship if they suspect each other of being an imposter. If the Crewmates vote everyone off or identify the Imposter, they win. However, if the Imposters eliminate everyone, they win&rdquo; (Bigley). Although it sounds like any other social deduction game, Among Us became popular for several specific reasons. Along its rise to popularity, it influenced a whole generation and an entire country. When Innersloth, an indie game studio, made Among Us, they tried to make it in the simple format of Imposter or Crewmate. That simple format and its straightforward rules makes this game accessible for all ages and levels. The diverse amount of people playing led all types of social media to pick it up. Tik Toks #AmongUs got 18 views. Among Us had over one millions posts on Instagram. Among Us was even on Youtube with big Youtubers such as PewDiePie shouting them out. This game has become so popular that Among Us has terms like Imposter and Emergency Meeting and the crown of them all &ldquo;sus,&rdquo; these words are now in adolescent&rsquo;s everyday vocabulary (Iyayi).</p>
<p><strong>BLOWING UP</strong></p>
<p>But why did it blow up? It can't just be because of the good game concept and the diversity of the players. Among Us blew up because it was good for social distancing from COVID. People started to play the game because they wanted a way to socialize with each other without getting sick with Corona virus. Among Us is a &ldquo;distressing game&rdquo; people say they play it for that. It is good to take breaks if you want to socialize (Bigley).</p>
<p>Covid 19 had a positive effect on Among Us because , when no one was watching the streamers during the pandemic, the streamers needed a game fun enough to entertain their views, and Among Us was the perfect game (Rodriguez). It was so perfect that it caught onto &ldquo;Twitch, Amazon&rsquo;s market-leading video game streaming service,&rdquo; and that started to spread it more (Rodriguez). If Among Us blew up because of CoronaVirus, what else has the game done to help people instead of providing a way for people to socialize in a very non social time?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AMONG US AND ITS EFFECTS ON AMERICAN CULTURE</strong></p>
<p>On October 20, 2020 an amazing 400 thousand people watched Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez play Among Us. Why would a United States Representative play a game about betrayal and lying? She also did it in front of thousands of people. She did this to advertise her voting plan. This caused a domino effect and now many politicians played video games to promote their campaign (USA Today). For example, Joe Biden making an Animal Crossing Island or Donald Trump making a twitch channel. However,none of these politicians did as well as AOC. The reason why AOC&rsquo;s plan worked so well is because of this stream. People started to vote that would have never voted. Just because she played a relevant game people started to listen to her. To add onto that Among Us allowed people to meet new friends. It also wasn't just for teenagers, adults played Among Us too. Such as a 36 year old writer and host of Internet Today plays in his free time. This helped friendships grow and made the game something that everyone could enjoy (Lorenz).</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>FUTURE OF THE SUS</strong></p>
<p>A new Airship map is coming to Among Us, the developers of Among US are working hard to rewrite the code to work with all of the new players. They&rsquo;re initial idea was to make a sequel to Among Us, but now they are just going to add new content to the existing game (Epstein.) This probably a good idea because if they made a second game it wouldn&rsquo;t blow up as fast as this would. The content that they are adding are new accessories that go onto your character in game. Also, new maps and new features to the game like the new sign in feature of Among Us. And the new way of using the chat. ]</p>
<p>Among Us is a game that has grown popular during a difficult time to become popular and at the same time help people during that time. Among Us has influenced people in the way they speak and even how they vote. Among Us is so popular that they don't want to get rid of it and make a successor. Among Us will continue to help people and help America as a society. Will the updates that the game will eventually release will also update America once again with new lingo and a way to connect through a device, when we can&rsquo;t in person.</p>

<p>AWE - Research/Informational</p>
<p>WRITER&rsquo;s REFLECTION:</p>
<p><strong>A LOOK BACK: </strong><em>Why were you interested in researching this topic? Write about your interest in it (how it &ldquo;kicked you in the discovery&rdquo;, when you first developed an interest, etc.). Tell the story of how your interest developed and why.</em></p>
<p>I was interested because I liked making ironic jokes about Among Us including songs, memes, and even videos. And now this. But this I actually got real information about Among Us. But I got the idea when my friend and I were talking about our research ideas when we came up with the idea &ldquo;What are the pros and cons of Among Us on American culture&rdquo;. And that was what &ldquo;kick we in the discovery&rdquo; And from that on I knew that I needed to make a paper on Among Us.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>A LOOK AT THE &ldquo;NOW&rdquo;:</strong> <em>Walking away from this experience with this new knowledge, what was the most important or interesting thing that you learned? (What did you learn from it/this experience? Why is it important to your life/in life?)</em></p>
<p>The most important thing I learned from this experience is probably that Among Us is very important for the ecommerce industry and even the video game industry. The most interesting thing that I learned from this experience is probably that Joe Biden has an animal crossing world.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>A LOOK AHEAD</strong>: <em>Has this experience sparked your interest in any &ldquo;new&rdquo; areas of your topic or beyond your topic? Write about some ideas for your next research experience. What parts interest you? Why do they interest you?</em></p>
<p>I think that this has sparked my interest for Among us because now I will know more about and know why and how it got so popular and how influential it was on america.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>A LOOK WITHIN: </strong><em>Of what part of this project are you the most proud? Write about it and your perspective.</em></p>
<p>I am most proud of the sources I found because I found so many. I thought I wouldn&rsquo;t find any on this topic but I found so much that I couldn&rsquo;t use it all or else I would have hundreds of note cards.&nbsp;</p>
